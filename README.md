# Arduino extension (more than one Arduino board - Custom components

This extension is the exact copy of hassio's arduino.py component. Without extension you can connect only one Arduino board. 
Using this component you are able to connect up to 4 Arduinos (by USB cable) in Raspberry Pi (Rpi has 4 USB ports)

<b>Installation:</b>

Instal the Samba share addon in Hassio (to see the config directory in your comuter (where your configuration.yaml file lives) on your PI. 
Go to config directory. Open custom_components folder (this folder isnâ€™t there by default, so for the first time you have to create it -? right click > new folder on a PC and name it custom_components).

Copy all files in custom_components. The directory structure will be CONFIG>CUSTOM_COMPONENTS>

<b>configuration.yaml:</b>


Hope this helps.
